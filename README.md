# Uber-Data-Analytics

## Overview

This project involves analyzing Uber ride data to uncover insights and trends. The analysis was conducted using various tools and platforms, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP),Compute Instance, Mage.ai, BigQuery and Looker Studio.

## Tools and Technologies

Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Used for data storage and processing.
Mage: Utilized for data transformation and orchestration.
Looker Studio: Employed for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing data insights.

## Dataset

TLC Trip Record Data Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

## Data Orchestration

- Data Extraction: Set up connectors to import raw data from various sources into Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Data Cleaning: Implemented cleaning tasks to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize data formats.
- Data Transformation: Applied transformation tasks to aggregate data, compute new features, and enrich the dataset.
- Data Loading: Load the processed data into BigQuery in GCP for analysis and visualization.

## Key Insights

- Identified peak hours for Uber rides and high-demand areas.
- Analyzed the impact of weather conditions on ride frequency.
- Examined fare trends and ride distances to optimize pricing strategies.

## Conclusion

This Uber Data Analytics project showcases the effective use of modern cloud computing and data orchestration tools to derive actionable insights from extensive datasets. By leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable data storage and processing, Mage for efficient ETL pipeline creation and management, and Looker Studio for powerful data visualization, we were able to transform raw trip records into meaningful analyses.
The resulting insights, such as identifying peak hours, high-demand areas, and fare trends, provide valuable information that can help Uber optimize its operations, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall service efficiency.
